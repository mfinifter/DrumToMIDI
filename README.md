Audio-to-MIDI conversion for drum tracks using deep learning separation, time analysis, spectral frequency analysis and frequency energy analysis.
--- 

### Attribution

This project was originally inspired by [LarsNet](docs/LARSNET.md) research for drum source separation. We now use the more modern and effective MDX23C model for stem separation. Many thanks to the LarsNet researchers for their foundational work in this field.

## Quick Start

### Choose Your Setup

#### 🚀 **Mac (Native + GPU)** - Recommended for Best Performance
For Mac users, native installation provides **7x faster** processing than Docker:
- **Setup Time:** 15-20 minutes
- **Performance:** 38s for 51.7s audio (sub-realtime!)
- **GPU:** Automatic Metal acceleration
- **Guide:** [SETUP_MAC_NATIVE.md](docs/SETUP_MAC_NATIVE.md)

#### 🐋 **Docker (Cross-Platform)**
Universal option that works everywhere:
- **Mac:** CPU-only (20x slower than native)
- **Windows:** Add GPU for 10-20x speedup ([SETUP_WINDOWS_GPU.md](docs/SETUP_WINDOWS_GPU.md))
- **Linux:** Add GPU for 10-20x speedup

```bash
# Install Docker Desktop, then:
docker compose up -d
```

**Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)**
```bash
docker exec -it DrumToMIDI-midi bash
python -m webui.app
```
Then open http://localhost:4915 in your browser. See [WEBUI_SETUP.md](docs/WEBUI_SETUP.md) for details.

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
docker exec -it DrumToMIDI-midi bash
```

### Performance Comparison

| Platform | Setup | Time (51.7s audio) | Speed |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| **Mac Native** | MPS | **38s** | 7x faster than UVR ⚡ |
| Mac Docker | CPU | 777s | 20x slower ❌ |
| Windows Docker | CUDA | ~40-60s | Similar to Mac native ✅ |
| Windows Docker | CPU | ~777s | Slow ❌ |

**Recommendation:** Mac users should use native setup. Windows users should enable GPU in Docker.

## Turning Drum Tracks into MIDI

### Where Do I Get A Drum Track?

There are a variety of tools available to get an isolated drum track from a complete song. I use Logic Pro's "Stem Splitting" feature.

When you have a drum track, place it in the `user_files/` directory, then run these tools in sequence:

### 1. Separate drums into stems
```bash
python separate.py
```
Separates drums into individual stems (kick, snare, hi-hat, cymbals, toms) using deep learning. The first time the tool encounters a specific song, it  will create a new project folder inside `user_files`, and move your track there.

### 2. Clean up bleed between stems (optional)
```bash
python sidechain_cleanup.py
```
This optional step removes bleed between drum stems using sidechain compression:
- Removes snare bleed from the kick track
- Removes hihat bleed from the cymbals track

Use `--no-clean-cymbals` to skip cymbal cleaning and only process kick.

### 3. Convert stems to MIDI
```bash
python stems_to_midi_cli.py
```
Detects drum hits in the stem files and converts them to a MIDI track.

It creates midi events on these "notes":
- kick 
- snare 
- hi-hat (open and closed)
- claps which often show up in the hi-hat track
- 3 toms
- cymbals

At this point, you can use the MIDI track as a replacement for the original drum track.

### 4. Render MIDI to video (optional)
```bash
python render_midi_to_video.py
```
Creates Rock Band-style falling notes visualization in an MP4 video. I view this on my phone while I play along on my Roland drum kit.

**Note:** On macOS, GPU-accelerated ModernGL rendering is used by default (1.7-2x real-time speedup). To use the legacy PIL renderer, add `--no-moderngl`.
