## Open Bugs (Not Yet in GitHub)

### Cymbals appeared missing due to --maxtime truncation
- **Status**: Closed (User Error / Testing Bug)
- **Priority**: N/A
- **Description**: Cymbals appeared silent when testing with `--maxtime 60`
- **Root Cause**: Thunderstruck cymbals don't start until ~90 seconds (intro is all hi-hat)
  - 0-90s: max amplitude 0.000488 (effectively silent)
  - 90s+: max amplitude 0.31-0.56 (actual cymbal content)
- **Resolution**: Running full conversion (no maxtime) detects 77 cymbal events
- **Lesson**: When troubleshooting, run full conversion first, then use maxtime for faster iteration only after confirming content exists
- **Note 27**: Still just a technical anchor note for DAW alignment (see `stems_to_midi/midi.py:64`)
